It is actually very easy and can be done in just a minute. Here are the steps:

Activate the uBlock Origin icon in the browser's toolbar and select the "open the dashboard" option to open the management dashboard.
Switch to the "My filters" section when the page opens.
Add the following two lines to the list of filters:
||youtube.com^$3p,frame,redirect=click2load.html
||youtube-nocookie.com^$3p,frame,redirect=click2load.html
Click on "apply changes" to save the new filters.
Once done, visit any site with YouTube embeds to test the filters. You can try our Vivaldi 2.10 review for example, as it includes a video embed.
